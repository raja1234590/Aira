# Aira - Frontend Assignment

Aira is your AI assistant that works 24/7 on your behalf. The main interaction happens through WhatsApp — you chat with Aira directly, and it manages your life across groups, email, calendar, and more.

The core concept is **rules**: you tell Aira what to watch for ("notify me if someone mentions my name", "flag anything marked urgent", "summarize this group every morning at 9am"), and Aira follows them automatically.

## What's Inside

This is a Turborepo monorepo with the following structure:

### Apps

- **`apps/aira-web`** — Next.js web dashboard ([app.airaai.in](https://app.airaai.in)) where users configure connectors, rules, and manage tasks

### Packages

- **`packages/core`** — Shared API client, schemas, auth utilities, and stores used by both apps
- **`packages/typescript-config`** — Shared `tsconfig.json` configurations

### Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** everywhere
- **Next.js** (web)
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **Zustand** for state management
- **Zod** for schema validation
- **Axios** for HTTP

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install


# Start the web app in development
pnpm dev --filter=aira-web
